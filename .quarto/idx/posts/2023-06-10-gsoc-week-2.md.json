By default, `plot_cap` uses the posterior distribution to visualize some mean outcome parameter of a a GLM. However, the posterior predictive distribution can also be plotted by specifying `pps=True` where `pps` stands for _posterior predictive samples_ of the response variable. Upon completion of the PR above, an example showing the functionality of `plot_cap` was added to the Bambi documentation in [PR 670](https://github.com/bambinos/bambi/pull/670). \n\nCompleting these two deliveribles early on in the program allowed me to spend more time on the design of the `plots` sub-package and implementation of `plot_comparisons` (which is ending up to be more complex than initially thought). For the design of the `plots` sub-package, I decided to create five different modules, each with a specific purpose. The modules are as follows:\n\n* `create_data.py` - creates the data called by the functions in the `effects.py` and `comparisons.py` modules.\n* `effects.py` - contains the functions (`predictions`, `comparisons`, `slopes`) that are used to create the dataframe that is passed to the plotting functions and or user when called standalone. \n* `utils.py` - contains commonly used functions that are called by multiple modules in the `plots` sub-package.\n* `plotting.py` - contains the plotting functions (`plot_predictions`, `plot_comparisons`, `plot_slopes`) that are used to generate the plots for the user.\n* `plot_types.py` - determines the plot types (numeric or categorical) for the the `plotting` module.\n\nThe modularization of the `plots` sub-package will allow for easier maintenance and testing of the codebase and offers re-usability of code using OOP principles. The modularization of code happened during the initial development stages of the `plot_comparisons` function. \n\nCurrently, `plot_comparisons` only works when a user defines the covariate and its contrast, and the covariates they would like to condition on. For example:\n\n```python\n# user provided contrast for `Age` and default grid \n# calculated for the conditional variable `SexCode`\nfig, ax = plot_comparison(\n    model=titanic_model,\n    idata=titanic_idata,\n    contrast_predictor={\"Age\": [50, 70]},\n    conditional=\"SexCode\",\n)\n```\n\nor\n\n```python\n# user can also pass a dict into conditional to define the \n# values used for the conditional variables\nfig, ax = plot_comparison(\n    model=titanic_model,\n    idata=titanic_idata,\n    contrast_predictor={\"PClass\": [1, 3]},\n    conditional={\"Age\": [50], \"SexCode\": [0, 1]}\n)\n```\n\nNext week, default contrast values will be computed for numeric and categorical conrast predictors. Additionally, default values for both numeric and categorical conditinoal variables will be added. This will allow the user to call `plot_comparisons` without having to specify contrast and conditional variable values.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Introduction\n\nI have been selected as a contributor under the organization [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org) for the Google Summer of Code 2023 program.
